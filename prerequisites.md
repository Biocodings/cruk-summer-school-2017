# Prerequisites


## R

We will be using the R statisical language throughout the course and include a *recap* of the R language at the start of the course. We highly recommend that you come to the course with some experience of performing the following tasks in R / RStudio:-

- Reading data from a csv file
- Loading the help page for a function
- Filtering rows in a table
- Producing a simple plot (e.g. scatter plot, boxplot, histogram)
- Performing a statistical test (e.g. a two-sample t-test)

Here are some suggestions of videos to watch before the course:-

- [Introduction to Data Science with R (4 free videos)](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034834.do)
- [Coursera four week course in R (week 1 only)](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/12/coursera-videos.html)
- [Bitesize Beginners Introduction to R Statistical software](http://bitesizebio.com/webinar/20600/beginners-introduction-to-r-statistical-software/)


## Unix

Many of the tools we currently use for the analysis of NGS data are run via the command line, rather than a GUI. In order to understand how to use these tools, you will need to be familiar with the Unix operating system and how to navigate yourself around a file system by typing commands. Here is an excellent online tutorial where you can try out some of these tasks for youself.

- [Command Line bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/)

## Statistics

Before coming to the course, you should be familiar with the concepts of hypothesis testing and how to interpret the results of such a test. We suggest the following resources as preparation for the course:-

- [Introduction to Statistical Analysis](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/IntroductionToStats/)
- [Statistics at Square One (Chapters 1, 2, 3 and 7)](http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/statistics-square-one)

# Other suggested reading

Althougth not strictly required for attending the course, the following resources should also be useful to you if you are new to Bioinformatics and Data Analysis

Indels
- second most frequent class of variants in the human genome, after single nucleotide polymorphisms
- indels range from 1 to 10000bp but here we are mostly considering small indels of 1 - 50bp
- there are around 200 frameshifting indels in each of us (1000 Genomes project, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20981092)
- indel frequency markedly lower than that of SNPs except near highly repetitive regions, including homopolymers and microsatellites.

Insertions and deletions have been linked to many diseases

Many indels exist in long homopolymers and repeats


Large cohort cancer genome sequencing projects
- mainly catalog indels along with other mutations
- sometimes include indels with substitutions in mutation clustering analyses
- recent Sanger Institute paper on 560 Breast Cancers searched for novel indel drivers in non-coding regions with significant recurrence (functional regulatory elements), Nik-Zainal et al., Nature 2016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27135926
- previously looked at association of indels with mutational signatures


Difficulty in sequencing repeat regions, particularly short read sequencers

Indels can cause problems for alignment tools
- many SNV/indel callers identify likely indels and realign all reads within vicinity

Many SNV calling tools also call indels, e.g. MuTect2, Strelka, VarScan2


Sanger CGP pipeline uses a modified version of Pindel

Pindel
- can identity short and medium sized indels up to 10kb
- uses a pattern growth algorithm for unmapped paired end read anchored to mapped mate
- initially written for short 36bp paired end reads
- updated to use split read mappings available with longer reads (>100bp) using latest aligners (bwa mem)


ICGC benchmark shows that indels are harder to call accurately
- Precision/Recall plot
- MuTect2 reports AF so use these calls to plot distribution of AF for different classes of indels (poly-A, poly-T, etc.), separate into true and false calls


Strelka applies a repeat filter
- somatic indels with a reference repeat count >8 (i.e. the indel is an expansion/contraction of a homopolymer longer than 8 bases, a dinucleotide repeat longer than 16 bases, etc.)

HCC1143
- indel size distribution plot
- proportion of somatic indel calls that are homopolymer expansion/contraction events
- any frameshift somatic indels?

"One of the most common genetic diseases in humans, cystic fibrosis, is frequently caused by an allele of the CFTR gene that contains a three-base pair deletion"

Reducing INDEL calling errors in whole genome and exome sequencing data.

- homopolymer A/T indels (poly-A, poly-T) are major source of low quality indel calls

"In Illumina data one can often observe low allele frequency indels in poly-AT regions, which are likely false positives."

"A very famous homopolymer run indel is the one causing medullary cystic kidney disease type 1 by disrupting the coding sequence within a VNTR of MUC1."

"Furthermore tumor suppressors, such as TP53, PTEN, BRCA1/2, RB1, STK11 and NF1, often contain large frameshift insertions and deletions (InDels) or complex mutations and sometimes even SVs [Ref: COSMIC] and are often missed by those variant callers."
"The effect might be even larger for tumor suppressors, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, RB1 and STK11, where InDel mutations are a common mechanism of loss of function but are poorly detected by other callers."

UK OAC ICGC
- use of Strelka for indel calling on over 300 oesophageal adenocarcinoma samples
- 70% of Strelka calls are in homopolymer runs of 5+ bp or 2-, 3- and 4-nucleotide repeats of at least 10bp
- 57% of indels are poly-A/T expansions or contractions by 1bp

## Analysis of Cancer Genomes

# Description

High-throughput technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) can routinely produce massive amounts of data. These technologies allow us to describe all variants in a genome and international collaborative efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) have begun to catalogue and release data on genomic variation in a variety of cancer types.

However, such datasets pose new challenges in the way the data have to be analyzed, annotated and interpreted which are not trivial and are daunting to the wet-lab biologist. This course covers state-of-the-art and best-practice tools for the analysis of cancer genomes. We describe, and give hands-on experience of, the entire analysis workflow from raw data generated by a sequencing machine to deriving variant calls (SNVs, copy-number and structural variants) that are ready for downstream analysis and interpretation

# Aims

- Appreciation of the nature and scale of NGS data and the requirement for sophisticated computational methods
- Describe theory behind current methods for calling SNVs and copy-number changes from NGS data, and their outputs
- Encourage exploration of NGS data using interactive tools such the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)
- Increase awareness of existing cancer cohorts and how they can be exploited

# Objectives

- Understand the main file formats used for NGS analysis (bam, vcf, bed etc), what is included in each file and appropriate tools for manipulating each file
- Know the metrics and tools that can be used to assess if a given sequencing run is adequate quality for analysis
- Understand the concepts and challenges involved in calling SNVs from whole-genome data
- Given a set of called SNVs, be able to 
    i) assess quantitively and qualitatively which calls might be "real" or not 
    ii) assess which calls might be biologically-meaningful and warrant further investigation
- Know how to access TCGA and ICGC data and how they can inform other studies


# Venue
